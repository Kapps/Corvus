DO NOW:
	-ControlManager.cs
		-when adding controls dynamically, settings focus doesn't work. need to find better way. 

TODO LIST:
	IMPORTANT:
		-Controls are currently hardcoded. (Files include: ControlManager, LinkButton);
    General:
        -Some way to set Vertical and Horizontal orientation.
		-find a better way of setting the Spritefont for controls. Right now, you have to manually set them all before using them.
    Textblock.cs:
        -
	Border.cs:
		-Not sure if i need to modify the IsVisible, IsEnabled, HasFocus, etc properties.
    ControlManager.cs:
        -Currently, the Focusable Elements are only added when SetFocus is called. Will need to find a more efficient way to manage this.
		-Doesn't add/remove elements within stackpanels, etc. Will add if needed.
		-Possibly combine Add/UpdateElement and Remove/UpdateElement.
KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:
    StackPanel.cs:
        -You have to put all the elements into the stack BEFORE setting the scale value. I Stupidly scale all the elements once you set the Scale value.
        The added items aren't scaled as a result.
