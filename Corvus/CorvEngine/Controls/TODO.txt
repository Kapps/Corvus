TODO LIST:
	General:
		-Some way to set Vertical and Horizontal orientation.
		-
	Textblock.cs:
		-find a better way of setting the Spritefont for controls. Right now, you have to manually set them all before using them.
		-Make the text start a new line when it extends too far.
	ControlManager.cs:
		-Make it actually do something.

KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES:
	StackPanel.cs:
		-You have to put all the elements into the stack BEFORE setting the scale value. I Stupidly scale all the elements once you set the Scale value.
		The added items aren't scaled as a result.
