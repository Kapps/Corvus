# A basic component, just to show-case that we can make a Sprite.

# Inherits BlueSprite, simply adding the Sprite itself.
PlayerSprite : BlueSprite
	SpriteComponent (Sprite)
		Sprite: Sprite(Sprites/TestPlayer)

# Inherits both BlueSprite as well as PlayerSprite.
# Of course, this is the same as just inheriting PlayerSprite since it inherits BlueSprite.
# Just to show off multiple inheritance/composition though.
